⭐ FIRST — THINK OF NER AND COREF LIKE A TEAM

🧩 NER = Finds names

Example: “State Bank of India”, “Microsoft”, “Azure”

🧠 Coreference resolution (Coref) = Finds who pronouns refer to

Example: “it”, “they”, “the tech giant”, “the bank”

NER does NOT know pronouns.
Coref does NOT know which words are named entities.

So we make them work together.

⸻

⭐ STEP 1 — NER FINDS ALL THE REAL ENTITY NAMES

Input text:

“State Bank of India partnered with Microsoft to build new AI solutions.
It will provide financial datasets, while the tech giant will offer cloud infrastructure.
They believe the collaboration will help millions of customers.
Microsoft said it will integrate Azure services with the bank’s systems.”

NER output:

Sentence - Entities Found
S1 - State Bank of India, Microsoft
S2 - (none detected)
S3 - (none detected)
S4 - Microsoft, Azure

👉 NER does NOT detect “it”, “they”, “the tech giant”, “the bank”
It only detects names.


⭐ STEP 2 — NOW COREFERENCE TAKES OVER

Coreference tries to answer:

“Which noun is each pronoun talking about?”

It sees sentences, context, and entity names identified by NER.
This is important:

🧠 Coref uses NER output as “anchors”

NER tells coref which things are definitely entities.

So coref knows:
	•	“State Bank of India” = an organization
	•	“Microsoft” = an organization
	•	“Azure” = a product
	•	“the bank” → probably refers to an organization
	•	“the tech giant” → could refer to Microsoft
	•	“it” → ambiguous, need context

Without NER, coref would not know “Microsoft” is a company.

⸻

⭐ STEP 3 — COREF LINKS PRONOUNS TO ENTITIES

Let’s walk through it as coref sees it, sentence by sentence.

⸻

🔎 Sentence 1

State Bank of India partnered with Microsoft …

NER: SBI + Microsoft
Coref: No pronouns here.

⸻

🔎 Sentence 2

It will provide financial datasets, while the tech giant will offer cloud infrastructure.

Coref looks backward:
	•	“It” → What was the last subject capable of providing datasets?
State Bank of India
(Banks provide datasets; Microsoft does not. Also grammatical structure.)
	•	“the tech giant” → Which known entity fits “tech giant”?
Microsoft

So coref assigns:

Word - Coref result
It - State Bank of India
the tech giant - Microsoft

🔎 Sentence 3

They believe the collaboration will help millions of customers.

Possible options for “they”:
	•	SBI (singular)
	•	Microsoft (singular)
	•	Collaboration (not a person)

Coref uses grammar rules:

“They” = plural

Which entity is plural?
→ The only reasonable plural interpretation is Microsoft leadership / team.

So coref maps:

They → Microsoft

⸻

🔎 Sentence 4

Microsoft said it will integrate Azure services with the bank’s systems.

This has multiple pronouns, so coref uses:
	•	Previous sentence context
	•	World knowledge
	•	Entity type
	•	Syntactic patterns

1️⃣ “it” → Who will integrate services?
→ “Microsoft”, because it is the subject of the sentence.

2️⃣ “the bank” → Which bank-related entity is known?
→ “State Bank of India”

Word - Coref result
it - Microsoft
the bank - State Bank of India

⭐ STEP 4 — NOW WE COMBINE NER + COREF OUTPUT

This is the key idea:

NER finds the names → Coref links pronouns → We merge both to create a full list of mentions per entity.

Final Mapping:

Entity - All Mentions Referring to It
SBI - State Bank of India, It, the bank
Microsoft - Microsoft, the tech giant, They, it
Azure - Azure


This is how the system knows exactly which sentences belong to which entity.

⸻

⭐ STEP 5 — HOW CHUNKING USES THIS

Now chunking becomes very easy.

For SBI chunk:

Include all sentences where SBI or its pronouns appear:
	•	S1 (explicit)
	•	S2 (“It”)
	•	S4 (“the bank”)

For Microsoft chunk:

Include sentences:
	•	S1 (explicit)
	•	S2 (“tech giant”)
	•	S3 (“They”)
	•	S4 (“it”)

⸻

⭐ FINAL SUMMARY (Super Simple)

✔ NER finds names like “Microsoft”, “State Bank of India”

✔ Coref uses NER to decide what pronouns like “it”, “they”, “the bank” refer to

✔ Everything is merged into canonical entities

✔ Chunking uses the merged mapping to group sentences correctly for each entity

This is how the pipeline handles multiple entities + multiple pronouns accurately.
