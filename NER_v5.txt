1️⃣ Input Ingestion

Input sources
	•	PDFs
	•	Word documents
	•	Text files
	•	Scanned documents (OCR-enabled)

Goal
	•	Accept raw enterprise documents with metadata (doc_id, source, domain).


2️⃣ Preprocessing

What happens
	•	Text extraction from PDF / Word (layout-aware if possible)
	•	OCR for scanned pages
	•	Sentence segmentation
	•	Paragraph detection
	•	Formatting cleanup (headers, footers, line breaks)

Output
	•	Clean sentences + paragraph boundaries
	•	Document structure preserved where possible


3️⃣ Named Entity Recognition (NER Module)

What happens
	•	Transformer-based NER (GLiNER / BERT / domain models)
	•	Dictionary / Gazetteer NER (banks, companies, products)
	•	Rule-based NER (dates, IDs, numbers, codes)

Detects
	•	ORG, PERSON, LOCATION, PRODUCT, DATE, MONEY, etc.

Output
	•	Raw entity mentions (explicit names only)
	•	Each mention has span, type, confidence

⚠️ Pronouns are NOT handled here

4️⃣ Entity Name Normalization (NEW – IMPORTANT)

What happens
	•	Normalize surface forms for comparison:
	•	Strip articles: the, a, an
	•	Case folding
	•	Whitespace normalization

Example
	•	“The Ministry of Finance”
	•	“Ministry of Finance”
→ normalized key: ministry of finance

Why here
	•	Prevents duplicate entities before aliasing and coref

⸻

5️⃣ Acronym & Abbreviation Resolution (NEW – IMPORTANT)

What happens
	•	Resolve short forms → full names

How
	1.	Explicit patterns
	•	State Bank of India (SBI)
	2.	Acronym dictionary
	•	SBI → State Bank of India
	3.	Contextual validation (fallback)
	•	Initial letters + entity type + context match

Output
	•	Acronyms merged into canonical entities

⸻

6️⃣ Alias / Synonym Resolution

What happens
	•	Merge name variants and descriptive noun phrases

Examples
	•	SBI ↔ State Bank of India
	•	Microsoft ↔ the tech giant
	•	Infosys ↔ the company

How
	•	Dictionaries
	•	String similarity
	•	Embedding similarity
	•	Domain heuristics

Output
	•	One entity = many name variants

⸻

7️⃣ Coreference Resolution (COREF MODULE)

Models
	•	fastcoref / SpanBERT / Longformer / LLM fallback

What happens
	•	Link pronouns and references:
	•	it, its, they
	•	the bank, the ministry, the company

CRITICAL RULE
	•	Coref does NOT create entities
	•	It only attaches references to existing entities

Filtering rule
	•	Keep only coref clusters that contain at least one NER entity
	•	Drop concept-only clusters (e.g., “this initiative”, “the agreement”)

⸻

8️⃣ Entity Normalization & Clustering

What happens
	•	Merge:
	•	Normalized names
	•	Acronyms
	•	Aliases
	•	Coreference mentions

Result
	•	One canonical entity per real-world object

Example

Entity: State Bank of India
Mentions:
- State Bank of India
- SBI
- the bank
- it
- its

9️⃣ Domain-Specific Extensions (Optional but Powerful)

Examples
	•	Ontology / Knowledge Base linking (Wikidata, internal KB)
	•	Entity ID assignment
	•	Numerical normalization (dates, currencies)
	•	Knowledge graph linking

Used when
	•	Finance, legal, healthcare, compliance domains

⸻

🔟 Sentence → Entity Mapping

What happens
	•	Each sentence is linked to the canonical entity/entities it mentions
	•	Uses:
	•	Entity mentions
	•	Alias matches
	•	Coref links

Optional
	•	Sentiment detection per sentence
	•	Stance / tone tagging

Output

Sentence 3 → [State Bank of India, Microsoft]

1️⃣1️⃣ Chunking Engine (NER-Driven)

Chunking strategies
	•	Entity-centric chunking
	•	Paragraph chunking
	•	Topic + entity chunking
	•	Multi-entity clustering
	•	Timeline-based chunking

Key rule
	•	Chunking happens ONLY after full entity resolution

⸻

1️⃣2️⃣ Final Chunks

Each chunk contains
	•	Clean, coherent text
	•	Entity-specific context
	•	Optional sentiment/topic tags
	•	Metadata (entity_id, source, confidence)

Ready for
	•	Search
	•	Analytics
	•	Knowledge graphs
	•	RAG pipelines

⸻

🔑 Key Improvements vs Original Diagram

✅ Added
	•	Entity name normalization
	•	Acronym resolution (explicit step)
	•	Proper alias resolution
	•	Coref filtering rules

🔁 Corrected
	•	Coref placed after alias/acronym resolution
	•	Pronouns treated as mentions, not entities

🧠 Clarified
	•	Coref ≠ aliasing
	•	NER defines entities, coref only links references

⸻

⭐ One-line summary (manager-friendly)

We first identify real entities, normalize and unify all their names, resolve acronyms and aliases, then attach pronouns using coreference, and finally create clean entity-aware chunks for search and RAG.
