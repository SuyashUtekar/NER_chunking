Yes — even the best NER + Coreference + Chunking systems have several edge cases, pitfalls, and problematic scenarios.

EDGE CASE CATEGORY 1 — Ambiguous Pronouns

Example:

“Amazon partnered with Microsoft.
It announced a new cloud service.”

Who is “It”?
	•	Could be Amazon
	•	Could be Microsoft

Even humans sometimes need more context.

Why it happens:
	•	Pronoun refers to the most recent subject (syntactic rule)
	•	But semantics sometimes contradict grammar

Coref models struggle when:
	•	Both entities are similar type (ORG + ORG)
	•	Both can logically perform the action

Mitigation:

✔ Use LLM-based coref — best at world knowledge
✔ Use additional features:
	•	Verb semantics (“announced” usually → company with press activity)
✔ Apply confidence scores and fallback logic



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 2 — Pronouns Without Antecedent

Example:

“It is believed that the company will acquire BetaSoft.”

What is “it”?

Sometimes:
	•	“It” is impersonal (“It is raining”)
	•	No real entity exists

NER + Coref incorrectly assigns “it” to the nearest entity.

Mitigation:

✔ Detect dummy pronouns
✔ Use semantic rules (“it is believed” → no real entity)



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 3 — Long-Distance Coreference

Example:

Paragraph 1 introduces “State Bank of India”.
Paragraph 6 says: “The bank also expanded its operations.”

NER + Coref often fail when:
	•	Entities are separated by multiple paragraphs
	•	Document is very long (PDFs often >10,000 tokens)

Mitigation:

✔ Use Longformer-based coref (handles long texts)
✔ Use sliding windows with context overlap
✔ Use LLM coref over paragraph pairs



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 4 — Multiple Entities of Same Type

Example:

“John met Michael after he visited the office.”

Who is “he”?
	•	John?
	•	Michael?

Ambiguity again.

Mitigation:

✔ Use verb semantics (“visited” → maybe the subject relevant to that action)
✔ Use role information (titles, organization)
✔ Use LLM reasoning



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 5 — Organization Aliases Not Handled

Example:

“State Bank of India (SBI) reported profits.
The bank also announced a merger.”

If alias detection fails:
	•	“SBI” and “the bank” may not merge
	•	Chunking will split incorrectly

Mitigation:

✔ Use alias matching rules
✔ Preload entity dictionaries
✔ Use embedding similarity (SBI ↔ State Bank of India)




EDGE CASE CATEGORY 6 — Nested Entities

Example:

“Microsoft Azure services were upgraded.”

NER might output:
	•	Microsoft → ORG
	•	Azure → PRODUCT
But what is the subject of pronoun later?

Example:

“It will be rolled out globally.”

Does “it” refer to:
	•	Azure?
	•	Azure services?
	•	Microsoft?

Mitigation:

✔ Use dependency parsing
✔ Use NER span hierarchy
✔ Apply LLM coref reasoning



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 7 — Incorrect NER → Incorrect Coref

If NER mistakenly labels:
	•	“Apple” as fruit instead of company
	•	“Jordan” as person instead of location

Then coref linking will be wrong.

Mitigation:

✔ Use domain-specific NER
✔ Allow model to override NER misclassifications



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 8 — Coref Splitting One Entity Into Two

Example:

“The United Nations met today.
The organization said it would deploy forces.”

Sometimes coref does:

Cluster A: “United Nations”
Cluster B: “The organization”

This causes duplicate entity chunks.

Mitigation:

✔ Use alias merging rules
✔ Use entity-type matching (ORG ↔ ORG)
✔ Use fuzzy name matching



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 9 — Misinterpreting Plural Pronouns

Example:

“The committee met with the board.
They approved the decision.”

“They” could refer to:
	•	The committee
	•	The board
	•	Both

Mitigation:

✔ Use sentence structure
✔ Use coref models trained on plural references
✔ Use LLM cluster scoring



EDGE CASE CATEGORY 10 — Garbage Text from PDF Extraction

Real PDFs contain:
	•	Broken sentences
	•	Hyphenated words
	•	Wrong sentence boundaries
	•	Missing periods
	•	Mixed headers/footers

This breaks:
	•	sentence segmentation
	•	NER
	•	coref
	•	chunking

Mitigation:

✔ Use dedicated PDF extraction tools (GROBID, Adobe Extract, pdfplumber)
✔ Clean text aggressively
✔ Use layout-aware models



WHAT DOES YOUR PIPELINE NEED TO HANDLE THESE?

✔ A robust alias merging engine

(“the bank”, “SBI”, “State Bank of India” → same)

✔ Confidence-based fallback

If coref is unsure:
	•	Do NOT misassign pronoun
	•	Mark pronoun as ambiguous

✔ Sentence window context

Use context from nearby sentences during coref

✔ Chunking should allow sentences to belong to multiple entities

Prevents loss of information in ambiguous cases

✔ Keep pronoun resolution scores

If low confidence → chunker handles carefully

⸻

FINAL SUMMARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Coreference resolution is powerful but not perfect.

It will inevitably encounter edge cases due to ambiguity in human language.

Your pipeline must:
	•	Use strong models (transformers, LLMs)
	•	Apply alias and pronoun rules
	•	Use confidence scores
	•	Allow fallback behaviors

If you do this → your NER-driven chunking pipeline will be strong enough for 95% real-world documents.
