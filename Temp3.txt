6. What Admin UI Explicitly Does NOT Show

Admin UI should not include:
	•	Prompt engineering playground
	•	Draft vs approved versions
	•	Prompt diffs
	•	Approval workflows

Those belong to Maker / Checker or system-level governance.

Updated Admin Responsibility Summary (One Screen)
Admin Responsibilities:
✔ Configure sub-feature behavior
✔ Set tones and limits
✔ Select KB sources (where applicable)
✔ Define project defaults
✔ Monitor usage & limits

Admin Cannot:
✘ Enable/disable core features
✘ Edit explanation logic
✘ Approve changes
✘ Override global policy


What is the need of custom prompt setup


Correct Modular Design (Recommended)

1. Separate “Prompt Templates” as a Platform Asset

Create a dedicated system-level entity:

Prompt Template Registry

This is not owned by Admin.

Owned by:
	•	Maker (create)
	•	Checker (approve)
	•	Super Admin (govern)


3. What Admin Should Configure Instead (Correct)

Admin should select and parameterize, not create prompts.

Correct Admin Controls per Sub-feature

For “Elaboration with Example”
Admin UI should show:
	•	Prompt Template Selector (dropdown)
	•	ELAB_GENERAL_V1
	•	ELAB_BANKING_V2
	•	Allowed Tones
	•	Max Tokens
	•	Default Tone
	•	Example ON/OFF (if template supports it)

Admin does NOT edit prompt text.

What Your Final Modular Design Looks Like for prompts

	•	Why
	•	When

⸻

What the Checker CANNOT Do
	•	Edit prompt content
	•	Create templates
	•	Change Admin configurations
	•	Bypass global policies


4. End-to-End Flow (Reconfirmed)

Maker creates template
        ↓
Checker reviews & approves
        ↓
Template becomes selectable
        ↓
Admin selects template + sets limits
        ↓
End users consume feature
