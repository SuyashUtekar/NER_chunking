Rule-Based Coreference Resolution (Classical approach)

✔️ How it works

Uses manually defined linguistic rules:
	•	Pronoun gender/number matching
	•	Distance-based heuristics
	•	Syntactic patterns
	•	“Nearest noun” assumptions

Examples:
	•	“He” → nearest masculine noun
	•	“It” → nearest organization or object
	•	“they” → plural noun phrase

✔️ Where used
	•	Early NLP systems
	•	Lightweight systems
	•	Software with strict latency requirements
	•	Cases where accuracy is not critical

✔️ Practical use cases
	•	Simple customer chat logs
	•	Short messages
	•	Rudimentary analytics
	•	Pre-processing for legacy ML systems

✔️ Pros
	•	Fast
	•	No training required

✔️ Cons
	•	Very low accuracy for ambiguous pronouns
	•	Fails in complex paragraphs
	•	Cannot handle real-world text well

2️⃣ Mention-Pair Machine Learning Models (Traditional ML Coref)

✔️ How it works

Train ML models (SVM, Decision Trees) to decide if 2 mentions (A,B) refer to same entity.
Features include:
	•	Gender
	•	Number
	•	Distance
	•	Word embeddings
	•	Syntactic patterns

✔️ Where used
	•	Intermediate NLP pipelines
	•	Systems built before neural models evolved
	•	Enterprises using older Java/NLP frameworks

✔️ Use Cases
	•	News articles
	•	Business documents
	•	Medium-complexity paragraphs

✔️ Pros
	•	Better than rule-based
	•	Relatively fast

✔️ Cons
	•	Weak on complex text
	•	Doesn’t understand context deeply
	•	Needs heavy feature engineering

⸻

3️⃣ Neural Coreference Models (Deep Learning, e.g., AllenNLP Coref)

This was a major breakthrough (2017–2019).

✔️ How it works

Uses neural networks (BiLSTM + attention) to compute embeddings of mentions and sentences, then cluster them.

Popular Models:
	•	AllenNLP Coref (Lee et al.)
	•	E2E Coref model
	•	NeuralCoref (spaCy plugin)

✔️ Where used
	•	Academic research
	•	Medium-scale industrial pipelines
	•	Document summarization systems

✔️ Use cases
	•	Corporate reports
	•	Legal documents
	•	Customer emails
	•	News articles
	•	Product descriptions

✔️ Pros
	•	Much higher accuracy than ML or rule-based
	•	Understands context
	•	Works well with long documents

✔️ Cons
	•	Slower
	•	Limited by pre-Transformer architectures
	•	SpaCy’s NeuralCoref is no longer actively maintained

⸻

4️⃣ Transformer-Based Coreference Models (State-of-the-Art)

These models use BERT/SpanBERT/Longformer-type architectures.

Popular models:
	•	SpanBERT-based Coref (best classical accuracy worldwide)
	•	Longformer Coref (supports very long documents)
	•	Coreferee (spaCy extension w/ transformer support)
	•	TrOCR-based coref for PDF documents
	•	GPT / LLM-based coref resolution (zero-shot or few-shot)

✔️ How it works

Uses contextual embeddings to understand meaning deeply.
Example:
“Apple released new iPhones. The company said it expects high demand.”
Coref model uses semantics → “it” → Apple

✔️ Where used
	•	Enterprise document processing
	•	RAG pipelines
	•	Knowledge graph construction
	•	Compliance & legal tech
	•	Financial analytics
	•	Customer intelligence

✔️ Use cases
	•	Contracts
	•	Market reports
	•	Annual financial statements
	•	Research papers
	•	Product manuals
	•	Whitepapers
	•	Security threat reports

✔️ Pros
	•	Very high accuracy
	•	Handles complex pronouns
	•	Works with multi-entity paragraphs
	•	Supports long-form documents

✔️ Cons
	•	Computationally heavy
	•	Requires GPU for speed

⸻

5️⃣ Large Language Model (LLM) Based Coref (GPT-based)

This is the new modern approach.

✔️ How it works

You ask an LLM:
“Resolve all coreferences in this paragraph.”

It returns a structured mapping:

State Bank of India → it, they, the bank
Microsoft → it, the tech giant

✔️ Where used
	•	Advanced RAG pipelines
	•	Enterprise search systems
	•	Document-to-graph conversion
	•	High-accuracy compliance and legal applications

✔️ Use cases
	•	AI agents
	•	Multi-document reasoning
	•	Long PDFs
	•	Zero-shot domain adaptation

✔️ Pros
	•	Best accuracy
	•	Understands world knowledge
	•	Solves ambiguity very well
	•	Works even without training data

✔️ Cons
	•	Higher cost
	•	Slower than local models
	•	Requires prompt engineering




WHERE EACH METHOD IS PRACTICALLY USED TODAY

✔️ Rule-Based
	•	Customer service scripts
	•	Chat preprocessing
	•	Banking forms
	•	Telecom logs

✔️ Traditional ML Coref
	•	Older enterprise NLP systems
	•	Legacy Java NLP pipelines

✔️ Neural Coref (e.g., AllenNLP)
	•	News agencies
	•	Universities
	•	SMEs running NLP locally

✔️ Transformer Coref (SpanBERT, Longformer)

	•	Financial analysts
	•	Intelligence agencies
	•	Research organizations
	•	Enterprise RAG systems

✔️ LLM Coref

	•	AI agents
	•	Knowledge graph extraction
	•	Semantic search engines
	•	Compliance automation

⭐ WHICH COREF METHOD SHOULD YOU USE FOR NER-DRIVEN CHUNKING?

If your input = PDFs, Word files, long documents, the best choices are:

1. Transformer-Based Coref (SpanBERT Coref)

Best mix of accuracy + cost + performance.

2. LLM-Based Coref

If you need:
	•	Multi-entity mapping
	•	Very high accuracy
	•	Cross-sentence reasoning
	•	Cross-paragraph reasoning

Avoid
	•	Rule-based → too low accuracy
	•	Traditional ML → outdated for complex docs
	•	NeuralCoref → not maintained



Example: How These Methods Behave on the Same Text

Paragraph:

“Amazon partnered with Google. It said it will support cloud technologies. The tech giant expects strong revenue.”

Rule-Based:
	•	It → Amazon (incorrect guess)
	•	The tech giant → Amazon (incorrect)

ML Coref:
	•	It → Amazon
	•	The tech giant → Google (maybe)

Neural Coref (AllenNLP):
	•	It → Amazon
	•	The tech giant → Google (correct)

Transformer Coref (SpanBERT):
	•	It → Amazon (correct)
	•	The tech giant → Google (correct)

LLM Coref:

Understands even nuances like:
	•	“It” refers to whoever took the action in previous sentence
→ Amazon
	•	“The tech giant” refers to Google because Google is widely known as “tech giant”

LLM gives perfect coref.

⭐ Final Recommendations for Your Use Case

Since your NER-driven chunking pipeline processes documents (PDF, Word) and must handle complex multi-entity pronoun resolution, you should:

✔ Use Transformer-Based Coreference (SpanBERT / Longformer) as your primary method

✔ Use LLM-based coref to resolve ambiguous cases

✔ Avoid rule-based / ML coref

This guarantees robust chunking even with:
	•	multiple entities
	•	ambiguous pronouns
	•	discourse-level references
	•	long technical or financial documents
