You an expert researcher and AIML expert 

I want to create a NER driven Chunking service that do chunking using NER, for my organisation, in which i will give textual data as input and then based on that i will do NER identification and after that using NER i want to create chunks of the text sentences, or paragraphs, in which chunks will not be the NER entities but the textual sentences or paragraphs 

So, initially i want to create high level architecture that fits to all the scenarios and categories of textual data and now I don’t want any code, just want that how i will initiate and create a architectural flow

And also for this i want to create a documentation that i will be using to explain everything to my manager



Give me the example usage on the above basic NER driven chunking implementation, so that i can understand how each step outputs



But i want chunks where each chunks contain sentences that has same NER entity,

So that for down streaming task like i want to search something about a particular NER entity so that i will get data or details about that in this NER entity chunk



Dont make this very complicated, my manager just want to know how will i approach and implement NER driven Chunking for each and every scenerios


Give me the differ NER methods and 

in this single chunking method is used, so give me some more alternatives that uses NER previously then chunking.

Along with their use cases that where can we use them



Give me the example usage implementation of all the NER first chunking method



Create a flow chart for NER methods and chunking strategies which were given above,
